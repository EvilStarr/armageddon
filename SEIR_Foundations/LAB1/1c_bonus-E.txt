Key update since “the old days”: AWS WAF logging can go directly to CloudWatch Logs, S3, or Kinesis Data Firehose, 
and you can associate one destination per Web ACL. Also, the destination name must start with aws-waf-logs-. 


Terraform supports this with aws_wafv2_web_acl_logging_configuration. 
Terraform Registry

Below is Lab 1C-Bonus-E (continued): WAF logging in Terraform (with toggles), plus verification commands.

1) Add variables (append to variables.tf)
variable "waf_log_destination" {
  description = "Choose ONE destination per WebACL: cloudwatch | s3 | firehose"
  type        = string
  default     = "cloudwatch"
}

variable "waf_log_retention_days" {
  description = "Retention for WAF CloudWatch log group."
  type        = number
  default     = 14
}

variable "enable_waf_sampled_requests_only" {
  description = "If true, students can optionally filter/redact fields later. (Placeholder toggle.)"
  type        = bool
  default     = false
}


2) Add file: bonus_b_waf_logging.tf (Look in Folder)

This provides three skeleton options (CloudWatch / S3 / Firehose). Students choose one via var.waf_log_destination.
